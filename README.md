# SimpleStack
A simple implementation of the Java stack interface

Write a program which implements a stack interface for integers. The interface should have ‘push’ and ‘pop’ functions. Your task is to ‘push’ a series of integers and then ‘pop’ and print every alternate integer.

INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept a file as its first argument. The file contains a series of space delimited integers, one per line.

    For example:
    1: 1 2 3 4
    2: 10 -2 3 4
    
OUTPUT SAMPLE:

Print to stdout every alternate space delimited integer, one per line.

For example:
   1: 4 2
    2: 4 -2
